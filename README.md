# VideoPoet is Google's A large language model for zero-shot video generation

a simple modeling method that can convert any autoregressive language model or large language model (LLM) into a high-quality video generator. 

It contains a few simple components:

 - A pre-trained MAGVIT V2 video tokenizer and a SoundStream audio tokenizer transform images, video, and audio clips with variable lengths into a sequence of discrete codes in a unified vocabulary. These codes are compatible with text-based language models, facilitating an integration with other modalities, such as text.

 - An autoregressive language model learns across video, image, audio, and text modalities to autoregressively predict the next video or audio token in the sequence.

 - A mixture of multimodal generative learning objectives are introduced into the LLM training framework, including text-to-video, text-to-image, image-to-video, video frame continuation, video inpainting and outpainting, video stylization, and video-to-audio. Furthermore, such tasks can be composed together for additional zero-shot capabilities (e.g., text-to-audio).

This simple recipe shows that language models can synthesize and edit videos with a high degree of temporal consistency. VideoPoet demonstrates state-of-the-art video generation, in particular in producing a wide range of large, interesting, and high-fidelity motions. The VideoPoet model supports generating videos in square orientation, or portrait to tailor generations towards short-form content, as well as supporting audio generation from a video input.
